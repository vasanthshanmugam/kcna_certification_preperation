Which API object is the recommended way to run a scalable, stateless application on your cluster?

A. ReplicaSet
B. Deployment
C. DaemonSet
D. Pod

### B. Deployment

The recommended API object for running a scalable, stateless application on a Kubernetes cluster is a **Deployment**.

Here's a detailed explanation of why Deployment is the correct choice and how it compares to the other options:

#### Correct Answer:

*   **B. Deployment:** Deployments are a high-level Kubernetes object designed to manage stateless applications. They provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets, allowing you to describe the desired state of your application. Key features of Deployments that make them ideal for scalable, stateless applications include:
    *   **Scalability:** You can easily scale the number of application replicas up or down by changing the `replicas` field in the Deployment manifest.
    *   **Rolling Updates:** Deployments support rolling updates, which allow you to update your application to a new version without any downtime. This is achieved by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones.
    *   **Self-healing:** Deployments use ReplicaSets to ensure that the desired number of replicas is always running. If a Pod fails, the ReplicaSet will automatically create a new one to replace it.
    *   **Rollbacks:** If a new version of your application has issues, you can easily roll back to a previous, stable version.

#### Incorrect Answers:

*   **A. ReplicaSet:** A ReplicaSet is a lower-level object that ensures a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time. While Deployments use ReplicaSets to manage Pods, it is recommended to use Deployments directly. Deployments provide additional features like rolling updates and rollbacks, which ReplicaSets do not support on their own.

*   **C. DaemonSet:** A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a Pod runs on all or some nodes in a cluster. This is useful for cluster-level services like logging and monitoring agents that need to run on every node. However, it is not intended for running scalable, stateless applications that may require multiple replicas on a single node or need to be scaled independently of the number of nodes.

*   **D. Pod:** A Pod is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. While you can create a single Pod, it's generally not recommended for scalable applications. If the node hosting the Pod fails, the Pod is lost. Deployments, on the other hand, manage a set of replicated Pods, providing high availability and scalability.
